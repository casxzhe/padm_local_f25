    "In this first project for 16.413 / 6.4132, we are going to look at the search and rescue domain using symbolic representations. We are going to look at both planning using PDDL, and also inference using PDDL. This project isn't going to focus on implementing specific algorithms however -- we're going to use two libraries: `pyperplan` and `sympy`. (You'll remember them from problem sets 3 and 4). \n",

    "Let's say that we have a \"search and rescue\" robot who is charged with navigating a sometimes dangerous grid to find and help people in need. We will restrict ourselves to a deterministic problem domain; we will however look at both fully observed and partially observed cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first focus on a single planning problem in the search-and-rescue domain, illustrated below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![search and rescue problem](sar_problem.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem features four \"people\" (bears) with names p1, p2, p3, and p4. A robot, initialized in the top left corner, should navigate to each person, pick them up one by one, and deliver them to the hospital (bottom right).\n",
    "\n",
    "* We always know the locations of the people, the robot, and the hospital. \n",
    "* Some locations may have walls in them.  **You know about all the walls in advance, as well.**\n",
    "* There is also fire!  And smoke!  But, initially, you may not know which locations have fire and/or smoke. Therefore, you need to move around in the domain, make observations, update your belief (e.g., infer whether there may be fire or smoke in the cells you haven't observed yet), make plans, and rescue bears.\n",
    "* Whenever the robot enters a grid cell, it observes the true environment state of all the neighboring cells.  Each environment cell contains exactly one of:  wall ('W'), fire ('F'), smoke ('S') or nothing (clear, 'C').\n",
    "* The robot may safely enter any cell that is clear ('C') or contains smoke ('S').\n",
    "\n",
    "We will first consider planning to navigate to, pick up, and drop off people at a hospital, and we are going to ask you to put this all together into a planning and execution system!\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at the code.  `State` is a class with the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"state_map\": a 2D numpy array of characters 'W', 'F', 'S', 'C'.\n",
    "* \"robot\": A (row, col) representing the robot's loc.\n",
    "* \"hospital\": A (row, col) representing the hospital's loc.\n",
    "* \"carrying\": The str name of a person being carried, or None, if no person is being carried.\n",
    "* \"people\": A dict mapping str people names to (row, col) locs. If a person is being carried, they do not appear in this dict.\n",
    "\n",
    "States have a couple of useful methods: `render` returns a string representation of the state (which can be printed) and `copy` does what you would expect. `get_safe_grid` returns a boolean numpy array where True represents a safe space (not fire or wall).\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions are strings:\n",
    "* \"up\" / \"down\" / \"left\" / \"right\" : Moves the robot. The robot cannot move into obstacles or off the map.\n",
    "* \"pickup-{person}\": If the robot is at the person, and if the robot is not already carrying someone, pick up this person.\n",
    "* \"dropoff\": If the robot is carrying a person, they are dropped off at the robot's current location.  *Allow for there being multiple dropoff locations, even though we will only dropoff at hospitals in this example.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Please now take a moment to read the docstring for `SearchAndRescueProblem` to make sure that you understand the state and action spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we're going to use a Python PDDL planner called `pyperplan` [(more info here)](https://github.com/aibasel/pyperplan) to find our plans. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's familiarize ourselve with State and SearchAndRescueProblem."

    "Now that you're warmed up, let's try making a planner to solve a SearchAndRescueProblem!\n",

    "The core function in this planner class is 'get_plan'. This function needs to do the following:\n",
    "1. Create PDDL domain and problem strings for search and rescue. The operators should work for any grid size, obstacles, people locations, and hospital location.\n",
    "2. Invoke `run_planning` using the given `search_algo` search algorithm with the `heuristic` heuristic.\n",
    "3. Convert the output of `run_planning` (pyperplan Operators) into actions that can be executed, via `execute_plan`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have given you most of the structure of the needed functions, but you will need to look (carefully!) through the provided python to find the `TODO` sections that you need to complete. \n",
    "\n",
    "For reference, 'get_plan' takes ~1-2 seconds to run with our implementation if using 'gbf' search and 'hff' heuristic. To get credit on Gradescope, make sure that your function finishes in <10 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**:\n",
    "* In this problem, you will need to construct somewhat complicated strings.  We *strongly* encourage you to read about [Python-3 f-strings](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-f-strings-to-create-strings-in-python-3) which make this process much easier than the alternatives.\n",
    "* You may find `state.render()` useful for debugging.\n",
    "* We also highly recommend printing out the domain and problem after they have been created, and copying them into [editor.planning.domains](http://editor.planning.domains) to check whether it's possible to find a plan. This editor can be helpful for syntax checking.\n",
    "* We also recommend writing careful test cases for yourself --- it's really easy to forget preconditions or effects. When we were debugging this, we forgot to make sure that the robot was at the location of the person that it picked up, so the plans were (confusingly) super short! \n",
    "* The image above with the robot and the bears is a faithful depiction of the initial state. For example, the initial locations of the people are: `\"p1\": (4, 0), \"p2\": (6, 0), \"p3\": (0, 6), \"p4\": (3, 3)`.\n",
    "* One part of this problem that may be initially counterintuitive is the way that we'll represent locations in PDDL. In the problem, a location is a tuple of integers. PDDL does not support such representations -- everything needs to be just an object with a string name.\n",
    "So to represent a location like (3, 5), we will make a string `\"l3-5\"` (where the first character there is a lowercase L), and we'll create an object with that name, of type \"location\". We will also need a way to encode the fact that the robot can only move between adjacent locations in the grid.\n",
    "In Python, we can compare the numeric values of locations like (3, 5) and (3, 6) to see if they are neighbors. But in PDDL, all we have are the objects with string names, and we need to encode everything in terms of predicates. So, we will create a predicate `(conn ?v0 - location ?v1 - location ?v2 - direction)`, which says that location `?v0` is connected to location `?v1` in direction `?v2`. For example, `(conn l3-5 l3-6 right)` might appear in the initial state. We can then use these `conn` predicates in the preconditions of a `move` operator to encode the fact that the robot can only move between adjacent locations.\n",
    "* We do not recommend modelling the hospital explicitly with special objects / types / predicates. Instead, the goal should be to deliver all people to the hospital, that is, `l6-6`.\n",
    "In words, the goal should be `\"person1 is at l6-6 and person2 is at l6-6 and person3 is at l6-6 and person4 is at l6-6\"`."

    "The real world is **partially observable**, where the robot can only see part of the world at a time. To handle this, we introduce the idea of a **belief**. A belief is simply the robot’s current knowledge about the world. It may include some unknowns, and as the robot moves and makes observations, the belief gets updated. In this project, a belief will look like the grid maps you’ve seen already, except with `\"U\"` entries for unknown cells. As the robot observes cells, `\"U\"` entries will be replaced with `\"C\"`, `\"F\"`, `\"S\"`, or `\"W\"`. We will also use logical rules (inference) to fill in what must be true.\n",

    "This grid has 9 locations and 5 observations: there is fire in the top left, wall below it, and the center, top right, and bottom right locations are all known to be clear of smoke or fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will assume the following axioms:\n",
    "1. Each location has exactly one of {smoke, fire, clear, wall}.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. There is smoke at a location only if there is a fire in at least one of the adjacent (above, below, left, right) locations. Diagonals are not adjacent!\n",

    "All three policies take 79 steps to solve each of the three problems (P1_B0/P1_G0, P1_B1/P1_G0, P2_B1/P2_G0), for a total of 237 steps each. This suggests that in these particular scenarios, the different strategies converge to similar behavior after initial observations—the robot quickly gains enough information that safe, reckless, and belief-space planning all identify the same optimal paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "If planning is very expensive compared to execution, choose the reckless planner since it only plans once initially and replans only when absolutely necessary. If execution is very expensive compared to planning, then choose the safe-and-smart planner since it guarantees no wasted moves into unsafe territory, though could modify it to replan more proactively when significant new information is discovered rather than executing a stale plan."
