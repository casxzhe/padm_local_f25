    "Though the game of tic-tac-toe is very simple, it serves as a good example for MiniMax search, alpha-beta pruning, and Expectimax search because it is fully solvable. In this problem set, you will implement MiniMax search with and without alpha-beta pruning, and compare performance. You will then simulate a full game to prove that an optimal strategy in tic-tac-toe can only guarantee a tie (against an optimal adversary). Then you will implement Expectimax search to play against a suboptimal adversary."
