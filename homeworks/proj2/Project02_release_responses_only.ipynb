    "The default heuristic only considers the Manhattan distance from the robot's current location to the hospital, ignoring the pickup requirement. My improved heuristic accounts for the two-phase structure of the problem by returning the Manhattan distance from robot to hospital if carrying the patient, or the sum of (distance from robot to patient) plus (distance from patient to hospital) if not carrying. Both heuristics find the optimal 18-step solution, but the improved heuristic expands only 31 nodes compared to 66 nodes for the default. This demonstrates that a more informed heuristic that understands the problem structure leads to more efficient search, reducing computational cost without sacrificing solution quality since both heuristics remain admissible."

    "The determinized agent chose to go DOWN, taking the shortcut through the one-way passage. The agent consistently made this choice across multiple trials, though it only succeeded on the 4th attempt due to stochastic fire evolution. The determinized planner evaluates expected costs by computing fire propagation probabilities and determined that the shortcut route had lower expected cost despite offering less room to maneuver. However, the fact that the agent failed 3 out of 4 times before succeeding suggests that the determinized approach may underestimate the risk of the narrow passage, where a single unlucky fire spread can block the only escape route with no alternative paths available."
